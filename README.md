# privateppooll
personal ppooll bits that are not in ppooll_contributions, feel free to add these to your own ppooll if you like. 
these are all pretty sloppy adaptations, but they work. 

the ar.* acts are just wrappers for some of the airwindows max objects (they're free as vsts you could easily run them that way via vst@). 

brown@ and pink@ are exactly what you think

waveletsScope adds a scope to wavelets. 

/BloomMe-ppooll is a "lazy" ppoollification of a max patch that adapts Eno's bloom app. 
Open it in max/msp while ppooll host is on and you can route the audio inside and around ppooll. 

any questions ask here or on discord @mutedial
